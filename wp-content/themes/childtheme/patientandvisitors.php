					<article class="ac-small">
						<p>Cardiac catheterization is performed to further evaluate coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, and/or certain congenital (present at birth) heart conditions, such as atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect, when other less invasive types of diagnostic tests indicate the presence of one of these conditions.
The person will remain awake during the procedure, although a small amount of sedating medication will be given prior to the procedure to ensure the patient remains comfortable during the procedure.

                                            <p>After the procedure, you may be taken to the recovery room for observation or returned to your hospital room. You will remain flat in bed for several hours after the procedure. A nurse will monitor your vital signs, the insertion site, and circulation/sensation in the affected leg or arm.
You should immediately inform your nurse if you feel any chest pain or tightness, or any other pain, as well as any feelings of warmth, bleeding, or pain at the insertion site in your leg or arm.
Bedrest may vary from two to six hours depending on your specific condition. If your physician placed a closure device, your bedrest may be of shorter duration.
In some cases, the sheath or introducer may be left in the insertion site. If so, the period of bedrest will be prolonged until the sheath is removed. After the sheath is removed, you may be given a light meal.
You may feel the urge to urinate frequently because of the effects of the contrast dye and increased fluids. You will need to use a bedpan or urinal while on bedrest so that your affected leg or arm will not be bent.
After the specified period of bed rest has been completed, you may get out of bed. The nurse will assist you the first time you get up, and will check your blood pressure while you are lying in bed, sitting, and standing. You should move slowly when getting up from the bed to avoid any dizziness from the long period of bed rest.
You may be given pain medication for pain or discomfort related to the insertion site or having to lie flat and still for a prolonged period.
You will be encouraged to drink water and other fluids to help flush the contrast dye from your body.
You may resume your usual diet after the procedure, unless your doctor decides otherwise.
When you have completed the recovery period, you may be discharged to your home unless your physician decides otherwise. Commonly, patients who undergo angioplasty or placement of a stent will spend the night in the hospital for careful observation.

                                            <p style="font-weight:bold;"> Cardiovascular disease is a category of diseases that involve blood vessels (vascular) and heart (cardiac). Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death globally. More people die annually from cardiovascular diseases. Most cardiovascular diseases are caused due to behavioral risk factors like using tobacco, unhealthy diet and obesity, lack of physical activity, harmful use of alcohol and diabetes mellitus. People with cardiovascular diseases need early detection and management. </p>

                                                   <p> It is the most common type of cardiovascular diseases. It is a disease of blood vessels supplying the heart muscle. It occurs when the flow of oxygen rich blood to your heart is blocked or reduced by forming a fatty material (arethoma) in coronary arteries. The coronary arteries are the two major blood vessels that supply heart with blood. As they narrow because of a build-up of arethoma, the blood supply to your heart will be restricted. This can cause angina (chest pain). If a coronary artery becomes completely blocked, it can cause a heart attack.

It occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is stopped or suddenly blocked, like all organs brain need a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function properly this is provided with blood. Stroke is the most common form of cerebrovascular disease. This  disease leads to the sudden impairment in speaking, thinking, movement and communication </p>

It is caused due to over load to heart, high blood pressure, damaged heart valve. It leads to certain disorders like chronic tiredness, shortness of breath, reduced capacity for physical exercises. It is a life threatening condition and cant be cured.               
Cardiomyopathy is a disease caused when heart muscle becomes enlarged, thickened reducing the effectiveness of heart and causing heart failure.

High blood pressure is defined as a blood pressure equal to or above 140/90 mmHg. However, individuals with blood pressure in the high-normal range (around 130/85 mmHg) are at increased risk of becoming hypertensive and should take steps to lower their blood pressure. Check with your doctor to see about your target range. </p></li>

                                                <p> Heart disease is a term used for describing a number of conditions affecting the heart. This includes blood vessel diseases like coronary artery disease; arrhythmias (problems with the rhythm of the heart) and congenital heart defects among many others. Heart disease is also known as cardiovascular disease, but the latter is a term used for conditions involving narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can eventually cause chest pain, a heart attack and stroke.

                                                    <p> Cardiovascular diseases are usually caused by correctable problems like lack of physical activity, an unhealthy diet,  smoking and being  overweight. Take note that the causes differ from one heart disease to another.

Heart arrhythmias are usually caused by heart defects, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, smoking and other lifestyle factors. Heart infections can be caused by parasites, bacteria or viruses.
Here are the top risk factors for developing heart disease: </p>

                                                    <p> Living a healthy lifestyle is very important when it comes to preventing or controlling heart diseases. Of course, it is also imperative to be supervised closely by a physician. If you have a high risk of heart disease, you need to get a regular check-up. One of the best ways to prevent heart disease is by not smoking or quitting the nasty habit. This will also decrease your risk of developing many other health problems. </p>

		    <article class="ac-large">
                        <p> Balloon angioplasty is a procedure that uses a catheter with a small balloon on it. The balloon is inflated to push apart the plaque in the clogged arteries. This improves the blood flow in the artery. This procedure is similar to a coronary angiogram. </p>                                              
                        <p>It is normal to have some chest pain when the balloon is inflated. Tell your doctor or nurse if feel any pain during the procedure. Risk of restenosis (i.e., the artery again narrow down due to the growth of plaque) of the treated artery is 40 – 50% in a patient.</p>

                    <label for="ac-16">Stenting</label>
		    <article class="ac-large">
                        <p>Your doctor may recommend placing a coronary stent in the diseased area to help keep the artery open. The stent is placed on a uniquely designed balloon catheter and then delivered to the diseased area. </p>
                        <p>The balloon is inflated to expand the stent and to flatten the plaque against the artery wall. This increases blood flow by holding the artery wall open.</p>
                        <p>Once the stent is fully expanded, the balloon is deflated and removed. The stent stays in place permanently. It may be necessary to place more than one stent, depending on the length of your blockage.</p>
                        <p>Stent implantation is a alternative to coronary artery bypass, which requires open-heart surgery. It can also be used to open blocked arteries in your brain, neck, kidney, hip, abdomen, thigh, and knee. More than one blockage can be treated during a single session, depending on the location of the blockages and the patients condition. Risk of restenosis (i.e. the artery again narrow down due to the growth of plaque) of the treated artery with bare metal stunt is 20-30%. With due eluting stunt, it has been reduced to less than 10%.</p>

		    <article class="ac-large">
                        <p> Your constantly pumping heart � you may not have thought about it much until your doctor told you that you have a problem with your heart rhythm, the speed and pattern of your heartbeat.  </p>                                              
                        <h3>Electrical System of heart</h3>
                        <p>In order for the heart to do its work (to pump oxygen rich blood throughout the body), it needs sort of �spark plug �or electrical impulse to generate a heartbeat. This electrical impulse begins its journey in the sinus node � the hearts natural pacemakers. The sinus node gives off electrical impulse that normally make your heart beat 60-100 times per minutes. There are conditions when the electrical impulse becomes blocked which causes an abnormal slowing of your rhythm. In other conditions an abnormal or irritable pacemaker may cause and an unusually faster heart rhythm to occur. Either too slow or too fast a heart beat may cause the following symptoms: </p>
                        <h3>Symptoms:</h3>       
                        <p>Symptoms of a heart rhythm problem include the following:</p>
                        <ol style="margin-left: 30px; font-style: italic; color: #777; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); margin-bottom: 10px;">

                                                            <p> Dizziness or light headiness.</p></li>
                                                            <li> <p>Fatigue .</p> </li>
                                                            <li> <p>Weakness.</p> </li>
                                                            <li> <p>Fainting spells.</p> </li>
                                                             <li> <p>Shortness of breath .</p> </li>
                                                              <li> <p>Palpitations (A fluttering, strong , or fast heartbeat).</p> </li>
                                                               <li> <p>Chest pain or discomfort.</p> </li>
                     </ol>    
                        <p>A Serious heart rhythm problem can stop the heart form pumping blood. This life-threatening condition is known as Cardiac Arrest. (Note: Cardiac Arrest is not the same as a heart attack, which is when a blockage prevents blood flow through a part of the heart.)</p>
                        <h3>Slow Heart Rhythms </h3>
                
                        <p>Sometimes the heart�s electrical signals are not sent, are blocked or take a detour, leading to a slow heart rhythm (bradycardia).  When the heart rhythm is slow, your heart beats too slowly, As a result blood doesn�t move through the heart and to the body the way it should. This may happen all the times or only once in a while. </p>
                        <h3>Fast Heart Rhythms </h3>
                        <p>Sometimes problem with the heart�s electrical signals lead to a fast heart rhythm. Too many signals may make the heart beat very fast (tachycardia). Or signals may be sent so rapidly and irregularly that the heart muscle sometimes quivers and doest beat at all (fibrillation). Because the ventricles do most of the work to pump blood fast rhythm in the ventricles are often more serious than those in the atria. </p>
                        <h3> EP Studies can help</h3>
                        <p>An EP is study is an accurate method for assessing the hearts electrical function. It allows doctor to locate abnormal sites inside the heart that may be causing serious arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). EP study can help determine exactly what your rhythm problem is and what can be done to control it. A specially trained doctor (Electrophysiologist) performs the EP study.
                            During an EP study, doctor insert special electrode catheters(long, flexible wires) into vein and guide them into your heart. Once inside, the catheters can sense electrical impulses in various area of the heart.</p>
                        <h3> Before The EP Study </h3>

                        <h3>Inserting the Wire </h3>
                        <p>The area (groin neck chest or arm) where the electrode catheter will be inserted is number with local anesthetic so you won�t feel the pain. A small puncture is then made in the vein. One or more catheters are inserted into veins and moved towards heart. Their movement is monitored on a video screen. The Catheter or catheters are then positioned in the heart. You won�t feel the catheters moving through blood vessels or heart. </p>
                        <h3>Studying your Heart Rhythm</h3>   
                        <p>Electrode catheters can record electrical activity in the heart. The catheters find where and when signals begin and how often they are sent. Procedures that may be done during the study include the following:</p>

                                                            <p> Electrical signals can be sent through the catheters to stimulate the heart. If these signals bring on an arrhythmia it is monitored. If you are awake you may feel your heartbeat changing or your heart racing from time to time.</p></li>
                                                            <li> <p>If an arrhythmia is induced, medications may be given to you through the IV line to test how they can stop the arrhythmia or keep it from happening.</p> </li>

                        <h3>Recovering from EP Study</h3>
                        <p>After the EP S is finished the catheters are removed and pressure is applied to the insertion site for 10 to 20 minutes. You will need to remain lying down for 4 to 6 hours to allow the blood vessel to seal. If the catheter was inserted into your groin you will be asked not to move your leg to prevent bleeding. You may go home from the hospital the same day or you may Stay one or more days.</p>
                        <h3>When to call your Doctor  </h3>
                        <p>Call your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms:</p>

                        <h3>Treating your abnormal Heart Rhythm</h3>
                        <p>The detailed information provided by your EP study can help your doctor plan the next step is treating your arrhythmia. Depending on your particulars rhythm problem, Treatment options may include medications, catheter ablation, or placement of a device to help control your heart rhythm.</p>
                        <h3>Medication</h3>
                        <p>If medications can help control your arrhythmia, your doctor will choose the type that�s best for you. In many cases the effectiveness of certain medication may have been tested during the EP Study. Take your medication exactly as prescribed and don�t stop taking your medication without taking to your doctor. </p>
                        <h3>Catheter Ablation</h3>
                        <p>Catheter Ablation destroys (ablates) an abnormal electrical pathway or group of electrical cells that may be causing an arrhythmia. The procedure is often done during or after an EP study. During the procedure an ablating electrode catheter is placed in the heart. Radio frequency waves are then sent through the catheter to destroy the abnormal pathway or cells. </p>

                        <h3>Pacemaker for slow heart</h3>
                        <p>A pacemaker helps treat a slow heart rhythm. It is a small lightweight, electronic device that�s placed permanently inside your body. A pacemaker keeps track of your heartbeat and, when necessary generates electrical signals similar to the heart�s natural signals. These signals keep your heart beating at the right speed. Lifelong, regular checkups help make sure that your pacemaker continues to run smoothly.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ICD For a Fast Heart Rhythm </h3>
                        <p>If you have ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation that�s sometimes dangerously fast, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may help. An ICD is a small electronic device placed permanently inside your body. Like a pace maker the ICD continuously monitors your heart rhythm. If it senses your heart beating too fast the ICD can pace the heart to slow down the heart rhythm. If necessary the ICD can also send out one or more electronic shocks to return the heart to its normal rhythm. Lifelong monitoring is necessary to be sure that your ICD continues working correctly and to check for any further changes in your heart rhythm. </p>

		    <article class="ac-large">
                        <p>The heart is a pump made up of muscle tissue. The heart's pumping action is regulated by an electrical system that coordinates the contraction of the various chambers of the heart.</p>

                        <img alt="Human Heart"  src="/heartcenter/images/electric-system-of-heart.jpg" style="margin-left: 500px;"></img>
                        <h3>How does the heart beat?</h3>
                        <p>An electrical stimulus is generated by the sinus node (SA node), which is a small mass of specialized tissue located in the right upper chamber of the heart. This electrical stimulus travels down through the conduction pathways (the way electricity flows through power lines from the power plant to your house) and causes the heart's lower chambers to contract and pump out blood. The right and left upper chambers of the heart are stimulated first and contract a short period of time before the right and left lower chambers of the heart.

The electrical impulse travels from the sinus node through the atria to the atrioventricular node  AV node, where impulses are slowed down for a very short period, then continue down the conduction pathway via the bundle of His into the ventricles. The bundle of His divides into right and left pathways to provide electrical stimulation to the right and left ventricles.

Normally at rest, as the electrical impulse moves through the heart, the heart contracts about 60 to 100 times a minute, depending on a person's age. Each contraction of the ventricles represents one heartbeat. The atria contract a fraction of a second before the ventricles so their blood empties into the ventricles before the ventricles contract. Under some abnormal conditions, certain heart tissue is capable of starting a heartbeat, or becoming the pacemaker.

<h3> An arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat) occurs when:</h3>

                                                            <p>The heart's natural pacemaker develops an abnormal rate or rhythm.</p></li>

<p>In any of these situations, the body may not receive enough blood because the heart cannot pump out an adequate amount with each beat as a result of the arrhythmia's effects on the heart rate. The effects on the body are often the same, however, whether the heartbeat is too fast, too slow, or too irregular. Some symptoms of arrhythmias include, but are not limited to:</p>

                        <p>A newer type of pacemaker, called a biventricular pacemaker, is currently used in the treatment of ventricular dyssynchrony (irregular conduction pattern in the lower heart chambers) or heart failure. Sometimes in heart failure, the two ventricles do not pump together in a normal manner. When this happens, less blood is pumped by the heart. A biventricular pacemaker paces both ventricles at the same time, increasing the amount of blood pumped by the heart. This type of treatment is called cardiac resynchronization therapy.</p>
                        <h3>Implantable Converter Defibrillator (ICD)</h3>
                        <p>An implantable converter defibrillator (ICD) looks very similar to a pacemaker, except that it is slightly larger. It has a generator, one or more leads, and an electrode for each lead. These components work very much like a pacemaker. However, the ICD is designed to deliver two levels of electrical energy:</p>
                    <ol style="margin-left: 30px; font-style: italic; color: #777; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); margin-bottom: 10px;">

                                                            <li> <p>A high energy shock that is delivered only if the arrhythmia is so severe that the heart is only quivering instead of beating. </p> </li>

                        </ol>
                        <p> An ICD senses when the heart is beating too fast and delivers an electrical shock to convert the fast rhythm to a normal rhythm. After the shock is delivered, a "back-up" pacing mode is available if needed for a short while.
The ICD has another type of treatment for certain fast rhythms called anti-tachycardia pacing, a fast-pacing impulse sent to correct the rhythm. </p>
                                            <h3>Components of a permanent pacemaker/ICD</h3>
                                            <p>A permanent pacemaker or ICD has three main components:</p>
 <ol style="margin-left: 30px; font-style: italic; color: #777; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); margin-bottom: 10px;">

                                                            <p>A pulse generator which has a sealed lithium battery and an electronic circuitry package.</p></li>
                                                            <li> <p>One or more wires also called leads. Leads are flexible wires that conduct electrical signals to the heart from the pulse generator.</p> </li>
                                                            <li> <p>Electrodes, which are found on each lead.</p> </li>
                                                            
                        </ol>
                                            <p>Pacemaker leads may be positioned in the right atrium, right ventricle, or positioned to pace both ventricles. An atrial arrhythmia caused by a dysfunction of the sinus node or the development of another atrial pacemaker within the heart tissue may be treated with an atrial permanent pacemaker whose lead wire is located in the atrium.</p>
                                            <p>When the ventricles are not stimulated normally by the sinus node or another natural atrial pacemaker site, a ventricular pacemaker whose lead wire is located in the ventricle is placed/used. It is possible to have both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and there are pacemakers who have lead wires positioned in both the atrium and the ventricle.</p>
                                            <p>An ICD has a lead wire that is positioned in the ventricle, as it is used for treating fast ventricular arrhythmias. Commonly, ICDs will have an atrial lead and ventricular lead.</p>
                                            <p>acemakers that pace either the right atrium or the right ventricle are called "single-chamber" pacemakers. Pacemakers that pace both the right atrium and right ventricle of the heart and require two pacing leads are called "dual-chamber" pacemakers. Pacemakers that pace the right atrium and right and left ventricles are called "biventricular" pacemakers.</p>
                                            <h3>How is a pacemaker/ICD implanted?</h3>
                                            <p>Pacemaker/ICD insertion is done in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, or the electrophysiology laboratory. The patient is awake during the procedure, although local anesthesia is given over the incision site, and generally sedation is given to help the patient relax during the procedure. A night or two of hospitalization may be recommended so that the functioning of the implanted device may be observed.</p>
                                            <p>A small incision will be made just under the collarbone. The pacemaker/ICD lead(s) will be inserted into the heart through a blood vessel which runs under the collarbone. Once the lead is in place, it is tested to make sure it is in the right place and is functional. The lead is then attached to the generator, which is placed just under the skin through the incision made earlier. Once the procedure has been completed, the patient goes through a recovery period of several hours.</p>
